# Dynamic Pricing Policies in E-Commerce
## Analyzing the Impact of Dynamic Pricing Strategies on Market Stability in the Airline Industry


## Project Description
The main goal is to
analyze how different dynamic pricing mechanisms impact market stability. This study
uses Agent-based Models (ABMs) to simulate interactions between autonomous agents
representing a duopoly of airlines with both myopic and strategic customers. The research analyzes the differences in impact on market equilibrium between three distinct
dynamic pricing mechanisms: assortment optimization, dynamic price adjustment, and
continuous pricing. 

The models are implemented in Python Mesa, an agent-based modeling framework effective to study the dynamics of a system and the impact of individual actions
and reactions in complex systems. It is used because of its because of its versatility and integration with other Python libraries.

Improvements could be made because ot the challenges when creating the ABMs. Consumer behaviors
could be implemented more realistically, by adding a higher variety of customers reflecting reality better. Including different types of firms in the models, would improve
the understanding of the influence of dynamic pricing strategies on market dynamics
and the impact of different stakeholders. Another way to improve the use of ABMs is
by collaborating with e-commerce firms to get access to data on pricing strategies, consumer behavior, and market dynamics, which could improve the validity of the ABMs.


## How to use?
The ABMs can each be used by running the following files:
* ABM_AssortmentOptimization.ipynb
* ABM_DynamicPriceAdjustment.ipynb
* ABM_ContinuousPricing.ipynbsbt or maven

When running the files, the models will be simulated with with various combinations of the number of myopic and strategic customers. The simulation results will be saved to disc and visualized.
